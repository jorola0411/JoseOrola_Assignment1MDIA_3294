MDIA 3294 Web Scripting 2 - Assignment 1 - Jose Orola A01329052

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This assignment is about creating a fictional store using React.js and with a minimum of 3 components. Using a third party package was required by the rubric, and Tailwind or component stylesheets must be used to style the application. Using Tailwind also counts for a third party package, So I opted to use Tailwind for my styling, as well as seeing it as an opportunity to learn tailwind.

--How to run the project--
Node modules are removed and not available on Github to reduce file size and to unzip the entire project faster.

1. Open the Terminal on the Navigation bar on the top, or Ctrl + ` to open the terminal.
2. In the terminal, input "cd JoseOrola_Assignment1MDIA_3294-main" to change directories to the folder that contains all the files and sub-folders.
3. In the terminal, input "npm install" **NOTE** you must have node.js installed in your personal computer first for this to work.
4. In the terminal, input "npm run dev" and click on the link to open the project.

Challenges:

Tailwind CSS: Learning Tailwind was a challenge on it's own, due to the lack of knowledge I had of it. I had to use a cheatsheet as well as watching some youtube videos on how it worked. Eventually I got the hang of it, but the main challenge was making my cards smaller as to not fit the entire screen and centered. 
Although I feel it there was another way of solving this problem, I fixed it by putting "min-h-screen w-2/3." min-h-screen makes the container as tall as the screen height, and w-2/3 makes the container 2/3's of the screens width.
